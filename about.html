            <h2>Starting around 2018, fox started streaming on a website named "Twitch.tv". At that time, it was under another alias as "Hidden_Kitsune". Kitsune is the Japanese term for fox. After roughly 6-8 months into streaming, Fox had changed his name to Hidden_FoxVR which was the start of that name gaining it's reputation. Over a period of 2 years, Fox had managed to make a small income from the platform. Enough actually to quit his job as COVID had started. From there, all of his efforts were put into the platform, allowing Fox to ammount thousands of followers and becoming relatively well known in the VR/VTubing industry. Over time Tiktok had come to fruition and that platform was another one to post content on. To today, Fox has well over 7,000 followers on twitch, over 1,000 on twitter, slowly built a YouTube audience, and well over 3,000 on TikTok and climbing. <br> Want to be apart of the Hidden kingdom?
